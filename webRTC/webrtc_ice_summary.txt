In WebRTC, each peer finds its own network routes (ICE candidates) after setting the local description. 
To connect, both peers must exchange these candidates.

The lines:
localConnection.onicecandidate = (e) => {
  if (e.candidate) remoteConnection.addIceCandidate(e.candidate);
};
remoteConnection.onicecandidate = (e) => {
  if (e.candidate) localConnection.addIceCandidate(e.candidate);
};
simply simulate the signaling process, letting each peer share its ICE candidates with the other.

Without this exchange, the peers know what to send (from offer/answer) but not how to reach each other, so the connection fails.

üîπ What happens without those lines:

If you remove them:

- Each peer will still gather its own ICE candidates (onicecandidate fires).
- But none of those candidates reach the other peer.
- Result:
  - The SDP offer/answer exchange succeeds.
  - The peers know what to send (video, audio, data).
  - But they don‚Äôt know how to connect, so the connection stays in iceConnectionState: "checking" or "failed".
  - ‚ùå No media or data will flow.
