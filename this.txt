At any single point in time, the this reference can only refer to one object, not multiple.

âœ… Yes â€” that's 100% correct across all mainstream programming languages, including Java and JavaScript.
ðŸ”¹ Key Concept:

The this reference is not shared across objects. It is contextual â€” at a specific moment in execution, it points to only one object.

So you're absolutely right to say:

It's like a context-sensitive alias that binds to a specific object in a specific call.

Think of this as a pointer that moves, but never duplicates itself to point to two things(object) at the same time.
